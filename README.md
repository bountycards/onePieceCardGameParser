# One Piece Card Game Parser

## How to use
Still working on getting different solutions together, right now the easiest way is npm package
https://www.npmjs.com/package/one-piece-card-game-json
```bash
npm i one-piece-card-game-json
```

Trying to get it on to a static API. There is still a lot I want to do but it's close to self sustaining already

## To Do
- [x] Main Scrapper that feeds into NPM package
- [ ] Make Feature/Unit Tests
- [ ] Better handle unknowns for when things get added
- [ ] Renovate for package dependency
- [ ] Full Cron and Auto PR Merging
