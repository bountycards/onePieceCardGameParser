# One Piece Card Game Parser

## How to use

Still working on getting different solutions together, right now the easiest way is npm package
https://www.npmjs.com/package/one-piece-card-game-json

```bash
npm i one-piece-card-game-json
```

There is a `nightly` version that does not get manually reviewed so use with caution but it will be updated the moment the cron runs and finds changes while `latest` will be reviewed by me first!

Trying to get it on to a static API. There is still a lot I want to do but it's close to self sustaining already

## To Do

- [ ] Make Feature/Unit Tests
- [?] Better handle unknowns for when things get added
- [ ] Renovate for package dependency
